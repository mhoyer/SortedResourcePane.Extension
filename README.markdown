# SortedResourcePane Extension for Microsoft Expression Blend

Did you ever noticed the unsorted list of resource files in the `Resources` pane in Expression Blend? This tiny extension will automatically sort the entries on any change.

## Warning

This software was not tested in deep by now (but will be soon). Thus use it AS IS and be aware of possible errors in Expression Blend -- even if I did not see any issues by time of writing. To disable this extension, simply remove the .dll from the extensions folder and restart Blend.

## Installation

Download [precompiled assembly](https://github.com/downloads/mhoyer/SortedResourcePane.Extension/SortedResourcePane.Extension.dll.zip) and extract the .dll to the Expression Blend 4 Extensions folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Expression\Blend 4\Extensions\`.

Simply build the solution. It will automatically try to copy the binary `SortedResourcePane.Extension.dll` to the Expression Blend 4 Extensions folder `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Expression\Blend 4\Extensions\`. This means you need Administrator privileges to do so.
